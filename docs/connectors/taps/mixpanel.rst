Tap Mixpanel
------------

Authentication
''''''''''''''

The Mixpanel API uses Basic Authorization with the ``api_secret`` from the tap config in base-64 encoded format.
It is slightly different than normal Basic Authorization with username/password. All requests include this
header with the ``api_secret`` as the username, with no password.

* Authorization: ``Basic <base-64 encoded api_secret>``

More details may be found in the Mixpanel `API Authentication <https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/data-export-api#section-authentication>`_
instructions.

The API secret can be found in the Mixpanel Console, upper-right Settings (gear icon),
Organization Settings > Projects and in the Access Keys section. For this tap,
only the ``api_secret`` is needed (the ``api_key`` is legacy and the token is used only for uploading data).

.. warning::

    Each Mixpanel project has a different ``api_secret``; therefore each Mixpanel pipeline instance is for a single project.


Configuring what to extract
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PipelineWise configures every tap with a common structured YAML file format.
A sample YAML for the Mixpanel tap can be generated into a project directory by
following the steps in the :ref:`generating_pipelines` section.

Example YAML for ``tap-mixpanel``:

.. code-block:: bash

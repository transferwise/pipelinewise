Tap Shopify
-----------

Configure access to your Shopify store
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In order to extract your Shopify data, you will need:

- Store Subdomain
- Private App API Password
- Start Date

Store Subdomain
'''''''''''''''

The store subdomain can be derived from your Shopify admin URL.

If your admin URL starts with :code:`https://my-first-store.myshopify.com/`, your store subdomain is
:code:`my-first-store`.


Private App API Password
''''''''''''''''''''''''

You need to create a `Private App <https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/private-apps>`_
API password to extract data from your Shopify Shop:

1. Log in to your Shopify store admin at :code:`https://<store subdomain>.myshopify.com/admin`
2. Click "Apps" in the sidebar on the left
3. On the bottom of the page, click "Manage private apps" next to "Working with a developer on your shop?"
4. Click the "Create a new private app" button
5. Enter a "Private app name" of your choosing, e.g. "Singer"
6. Enter your email address under "Emergency developer email"
7. In the "Admin API" section, click "â–¼ Review disabled Admin API permissions"
8. Choose "Read access" rather than "No access" in the access level dropdowns for the following permissions:

   1. Products, variants and collections - :code:`read_products, write_products`
   2. Orders, transactions and fulfillments - :code:`read_orders, write_orders`
   3. Customer details and customer groups - :code:`read_customers, write_customers`

9. Click "Save"
10. In the modal that appears, click "I understand, create the app"

Once the app has been created, you can locate the API password:

1. In the "Admin API" section on the private app details page, find the "Password" field and click "Show"
2. The value that appears (starting with :code:`shppa_`) is your API password.

Start Date
''''''''''

This property determines how much historical data will be extracted.


Configuring what to extract
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PipelineWise configures every tap with a common structured YAML file format.
A sample YAML for Jira replication can be generated into a project directory by
following the steps in the :ref:`generating_pipelines` section.

Example YAML for ``tap-shopify``:

.. code-block:: bash

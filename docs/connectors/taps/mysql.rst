Tap MySQL

MySQL setup requirements
''''''''''''''''''''''''

*(Section based on Stitch documentation)*

**Step 1: Check if you have all the required credentials for replicating data from MySQL**

* The ``CREATE USER`` or ``INSERT`` privilege (for the mysql database). The ``CREATE USER`` privilege is required to create a database user for PipelineWise.

* The ``GRANT OPTION`` privilege in MySQL. The ``GRANT OPTION`` privilege is required to grant the necessary privileges to the PipelineWise database user.

* The ``SUPER`` privilege in MySQL. If using :ref:`log_based`, the ``SUPER`` privilege is required to define the appropriate server settings.

**Step 2: Configuring database server settings**

.. note::

  This step is only required if you use :ref:`log_based` replication method.


.. warning::

  To use binlog replication, your MySQL database must be running MySQL version 5.6.2 or greater.

1. Log into your MySQL server.

2. Verify that binlog is enabled by running the following statement. The value returned should be 1:

.. code-block:: bash

    mysql> select @@log_bin;


3. Locate the ``my.cnf file``, usually located at ``/etc/my.cnf``. Verify that ``my.cnf`` has the following lines in the mysqld section:

.. code-block:: bash

    mysql> select @@log_bin;

    [mysqld]
    binlog_format=ROW
    binlog_row_image=FULL
    expire_logs_days=7
    binlog_expire_logs_seconds=604800
    log_bin=mysql-binlog
    log_slave_updates=1

A few things to note:

  * ``log_bin`` doesn’t have to be ``mysql-binlog`` - this value can be anything. Additionally, if ``log_bin`` already has an entry (which you checked in step one), you don’t need to change it.
  
  * Use either ``expire_log_days`` or ``binlog_expire_logs_seconds``, not both
  
  * Setting ``log_slave_updates`` is only required if you are connecting a read replica. This isn’t required for master instances.


4. When finished, restart your MySQL server to ensure the changes take effect.


**Step 3. Create a PipelineWise database user**

Next, you’ll create a dedicated database user for PipelineWise. The user needs to have:

    * ``SELECT`` privileges on the database and every table that you want to replicate.

    *  If using :ref:`log_based`, you'll also need to grant ``REPLICATION CLIENT`` and ``REPLICATION SLAVE`` privileges.


Configuring what to replicate
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PipelineWise configures every tap with a common structured YAML file format.
A sample YAML for MySQL replication can be generated into a project directory by
following the steps in the :ref:`generating_pipelines` section.

Example YAML for ``tap-mysql``:

.. code-block:: bash

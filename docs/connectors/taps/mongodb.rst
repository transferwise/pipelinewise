Tap MongoDB
-----------


MongoDB setup requirements
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**Step 1: Check if you have all the required credentials for replicating data from MongoDB**

* The user must have one of the following roles: ``read``, ``readWrite``, ``readAnyDatabase``, ``readWriteAnyDatabase``, ``dbOwner``, ``backup``, ``root``. These roles allow PipelineWise to see and read from the dbs to sync from.

* If privileges are set, the user must have at least these two actions: ``find`` and ``changeStream``. These actions are necessary because they're the actions that PipelineWise performs while syncing.


**Step 2: Required database server settings**

.. note::

  This step is only required if you use :ref:`log_based` replication method.


.. warning::

  To use log_based replication, your MongoDB server must be running MongoDB version 3.6 or greater, is either a replica set or sharded cluster and majority read concern is enabled.

  The ``log_based`` replication makes use of ChangeStreams that were introduced in version 3.6, for more info on ChangeStreams, head over to `the official documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/>`_.


**Step 3. Create a PipelineWise database user**

Next, youâ€™ll create a dedicated user for PipelineWise. The user needs to have:

* One of the roles ``read``, ``readWrite``, ``readAnyDatabase``, ``readWriteAnyDatabase``, ``dbOwner``, ``backup``, ``root`` on the database that you want to replicate
* ``find`` & ``changeStream`` privileges on the every collection that you want to replicate.

Example:


.. code-block:: js

	db.createRole({

		"role" : "PipelineWiseRole",
		"privileges" : [{

			"resource" :{

				"db" : "my_db",
				"collection" : "my_collection"

			},
			"actions" : ["find", "changeStream"]

		}],
		"roles" : [{"role": "read", "db": "my_db"}]

	});

	db.createUser({

		"user" : "PipelineWiseUser",
		"pwd": "mY_VerY_StRonG_PaSSwoRd",
		"roles" : ["PipelineWiseRole"]

	});


Configuring what to replicate
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PipelineWise configures every tap with a common structured YAML file format.
A sample YAML for MongoDB replication can be generated into a project directory by
following the steps in the :ref:`generating_pipelines` section.

Example YAML for ``tap-mongodb``:

.. code-block:: bash

Tap Google Analytics
-----------


Configuring what to replicate
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PipelineWise configures every tap with a common structured YAML file format.
A sample YAML for Google Analytics replication can be generated into a project directory by
following the steps in the :ref:`generating_pipelines` section.

Authorization Methods
'''''''''''''''''''''

``tap-google-analytics`` supports two different ways of authorization:

 - **Service account based authorization**, where an administrator manually creates a service account with the appropriate permissions to view the account, property, and view you wish to fetch data from
 - **OAuth** ``access_token`` **based authorization**, where this tap gets called with a valid ``access_token`` and ``refresh_token`` produced by an OAuth flow conducted in a different system.

If you're setting up ``tap-google-analytics`` for your own organization and only plan to extract from a handful of different views in the same limited set of properties, Service Account based authorization is the simplest. When you create a service account Google gives you a json file with that service account's credentials called the ``client_secrets.json``, and that's all you need to pass to this tap, and you only have to do it once, so this is the recommended way of configuring ``tap-google-analytics``.

If you're building something where a wide variety of users need to be able to give access to their Google Analytics, ``tap-google-analytics`` can use an ``access_token`` granted by those users to authorize it's requests to Google. This ``access_token`` is produced by a normal Google OAuth flow, but this flow is outside the scope of ``tap-google-analytics``. This is useful if you're integrating ``tap-google-analytics`` with another system, like Stitch Data might do to allow users to configure their extracts themselves without manual config setup. This tap expects an ``access_token``, ``refresh_token``, ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` to be passed to it in order to authenticate as the user who granted the token and then access their data.

.. warning::

  This tap does not currently use any ``STATE`` information for incrementally extracting data. This is currently mitigated by allowing for chunked runs using ``[start_date, end_date]``, but we should definitely add support for using ``STATE`` messages.

  The difficulty on that front is on dynamically deciding which attributes to use for capturing state for ad-hoc reports that do not include the `ga:date` dimension or other combinations of Time Dimensions.

Example YAML for ``tap-google-analytics``:
